# DeepLearning-and-NeuralNetwork
Deep Learning repository 

This a deep learning respository for training purposes only. The notebooks are summaries of chapters in the 2nd part of the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow". 

All the Neural Network models are developed using the "Keras" module inside "TensorFlow". The "Tensorboard" module in "TensorFlow" is used to visualize the results (validation and test).
